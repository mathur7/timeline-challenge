Construct a timeline to browse all the commands sent to student chromebooks during a classroom session. 
Commands are created by teachers and sent to a subset of students in their classroom (not always the same students). 

DONE

- design, styling and layout of the timeline with hard coded data in html
- basic interaction for showing and hiding of the bubbles associated with the timeslot
- basic interaction for showing and hiding of student list on clicking the show more text
- create mock data in javascript using object literals and replace html data by consuming these objects
- separated interaction from data by creating two separate js files

TO DO

- fix dismissing of bubble by clicking anywhere else on the page
- fix data for show more students in js (hardcoded within html at the moment)
- refactor data js file to make it more readable (at the moment it's cluttered and how)
- long term goal: switch data to api layer and use client-side/server-side templating to create a cleaner interface and to ensure separation of concerns, decoupling of backend from the frontend
